The todo list is broken down into the following sections:
Drivers: Specific drivers that need creating
Core: Items that affect the main framework
Testability: Items surounding the test framework
Bugs: Known problems with current implementation

Drivers
=======
// There are probably more useful web services with JSON apis to wrap,
// these can all go in 'netdriver'
*WebServices
  - exchange (XE.com?)
    command: exchange, convert
    exchange 10 GBP to USD

  - weather (weather.com?)
    weather manchester, uk

  - google?
  - ftse or other share indexen?

  - soundcloud
    follow particular bands/users to announce when they post new tracks
    (would require API use since they don't expose simple RSS feeds)

*Remind
  // Remind me, (or someone) about something at a certain point in the future
  // Still TODO:
  - repeating reminders -- daily, weekly, monthly. no shorter than hourly ;-)
  - split tell stuff out to a notify driver
  - add "ping me when x next says something" to notify driver

*calc
  // Make the calc driver do date / timezone maths.
  date
  date uk
  date shanghai

*urlsearch
  //Keep a track of urls that are said and allow them to be searched (using regex)
  // Still TODO:
  - get hosting and buy sp0rk.ly

*Quotes
  // Still TODO: some...
  - Multi-line quote add for copypasta win?
    + q(uote )?begin
    + record all lines said by Nick
    + q(uote )?end
  - Multi-line quote storage? (means parsing logic in quoteimporter)
  - Quote stats (use access counts)
  - Help, unit tests, etc.

*Factoids
  // Still TODO
  - Permissions system:
    + each factoid has "owner" == creator initially
    + owner can set factoid read-only, prevents others modifying/deleting
    + need some mechanism for giving/taking ownership (someone needs "root")
  - The ability to apply commands to something other than the last factoid seen
    via "literal" to list then s/that/N/ in command to apply.
  - The above but operating on all factoids associated with a key.
  - Something that utilises the access count to help prune unseen factoids
  - Regex factoid value editing: edit that =~ s/// => applies regex to factoid
  - More unit tests
  - Pruning of 404'd F_URL factoids

*Insult generator
  - needed for many many factoids :-)

*Trivia
  - does anyone care about this? the question list is a bit meh atm.

Core
====

* Persistent ignore list
* Admin commands like join/part/ignore (and perms)
* Push servemux-like command/handler dispatch up into a layer in goirc.
* Help: look into godoc -> wiki.git dumping

Testability
===========

* Ensure all functions (where applicable) have unit tests
* mock/fake the DB connection

Bugs
====

Many, natch.
